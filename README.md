Prediction of protein-protein interfaces based on machine learning methods

Proteins play key roles in various aspects of life by physically interacting with other proteins. Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are the molecular basis for many biological processes, such as signal transduction, transport, metabolism, gene expression, growth and proliferation of cells. Protein-binding interfaces are heterogeneous and some interface residues contribute more to binding than the others. These residues are called “hotspots”. Hotspots are often pre-organized in the unbound protein state. So it is suggested that much of the protein surface does not accommodate binding and the potential binding sites of a protein are already imprinted in its unbound state.
